# A note on what is deliberately turned off, and why:
#   * BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF, BUILD_STATIC_LIBS ON: git links the archive, and a
#     static curl(1) has no runtime closure to get wrong.
#   * ENABLE_CURL_MANUAL OFF: `curl --manual` would embed the whole manpage in
#     the binary. `curl --help` is unaffected.
#   * TLS: mbedTLS only. OpenSSL/GnuTLS/wolfSSL/Rustls off -- none are ported,
#     and letting CMake probe the host could link the host's OpenSSL.
#   * Every optional codec/resolver library (zlib, brotli, zstd, nghttp2,
#     libidn2, libpsl, c-ares, GSSAPI, libssh) OFF: none are in the sysroot.
#     Without CURL_USE_LIBPSL=OFF the configure step *errors* rather than
#     silently continuing. zlib off only means curl won't do transfer-encoding
#     gzip; git does its own object compression, so http transport is unaffected.
#   * Threaded resolver OFF: matches git's NO_PTHREADS posture and keeps the
#     synchronous getaddrinfo path, which is all the kernel resolver needs.
#   * IPv6 OFF: the Tunix net stack is IPv4-only, and an AF_INET6 socket() would
#     just fail; disabling it avoids curl trying and logging errors.
#   * Protocols reduced to HTTP(S) plus FILE: that is everything git drives
#     through the remote-http helper, and everything the tool can reach given
#     an IPv4 client-only TCP stack. The rest would only fail at runtime.
#   * CA bundle baked to the guest path /etc/ssl/cert.pem, which the mbedtls
#     port already installs into the rootfs. mbedTLS has no default CA store, so
#     without this git could not verify any certificate.
# CMAKE_USE_PKGCONFIG/CMAKECONFIG OFF stop CMake from discovering host copies of
# any of the above.
