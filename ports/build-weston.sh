# Build Weston for Tunix -- DRM and headless backends, software renderer.
#
# The headless backend renders into memory and presents nowhere, which is what
# proved the *system* works: unix sockets, SCM_RIGHTS, memfd, epoll, signalfd,
# flock. The DRM backend is the one that puts pixels on the actual screen,
# through /dev/dri/card0. Both are built; headless stays the default so a
# machine with no usable display still gets a compositor.
#
# What the DRM backend drags in, and why it is finally possible:
#
#   libseat          weston 14's only launcher. Its builtin backend plus
#                    SEATD_VTBOUND=0 avoids both a daemon and the VT ioctls
#                    Tunix has no virtual terminals for -- see build-seatd.sh.
#   libdisplay-info  required unconditionally; parses EDID we never supply.
#   libudev          libudev-zero over the synthetic /sys, to find card0.
#
# The GL renderer is on. It composites through EGL on a GBM surface rather than
# blitting every frame on the CPU with pixman. There is no GPU: mesa's GBM falls
# back to kms_swrast, which allocates DRM dumb buffers and rasterises with
# softpipe, so the drawing is still software -- but the frame is assembled once,
# in a buffer the display can scan out, instead of being composited and then
# copied. It also gives clients a real EGL to render into.
#
# Still off, and why:
#
#   xwayland         an X server is a project of its own
#   image-jpeg/webp  decoders for backgrounds we do not ship
#   demo-clients     several of them want pangocairo, which is not ported
#
# weston-terminal *is* built (-Dtools=terminal): it is what the panel's one
# launcher starts, and it needs nothing beyond the toy toolkit -- wayland-client,
# cairo, xkbcommon and wayland-cursor, all of which are already here.
#
# The tests are also off: they assume a full session and a runnable target.
#
# Output layout:
#   $OUT/weston-root/usr/bin/weston            the compositor
#   $OUT/weston-root/usr/lib/{libweston-*,weston}  its modules
#   $OUT/weston-root/usr/share/weston          shell data
