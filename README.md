# Tunix

Tunix is a small Unix-like operating system experiment for x86_64. It includes a custom bootloader, kernel, initramfs-based userspace, framebuffer terminal, and a small set of ported userland tools.

## Features

- Custom bootloader and kernel code
- Persistent ext2 root filesystem on the boot disk (Linux-mountable); the
  initramfs only seeds it on first boot
- tmpfs-like volatile `/tmp`, `/run`, `/dev`, `/proc`
- Framebuffer terminal with keyboard input
- Basic VFS, devfs, procfs, process, and syscall support
- Symmetric multiprocessing: every processor the firmware describes is started
  and the scheduler runs processes on all of them — see
  [Multiprocessor](docs/multiprocessor.md)
- GNU userland (coreutils, grep, sed, gawk, findutils, diffutils, tar, gzip, make), Bash, TinyCC, binutils, nano, Lua, and selected libraries
- CPython 3.14, built shared so `ctypes` and C extensions load; `python-test`
  exercises threads, subprocess, signals, sockets, epoll, mmap and sqlite3
- `curl`, and Git's `https://` transport, both out of one static curl port
  built against mbedTLS — so `curl https://…` and `git clone https://…` work.
  The tool speaks http, https and file over IPv4; `ssh://` remotes are not
  supported
- Intel HD Audio playback behind ALSA's `/dev/snd` interface, with alsa-lib
  ported on top of it: `snd-test` drives the kernel ioctls directly and
  `alsa-test` goes through the library, mixer included
- dinit as PID 1: services under `/etc/dinit.d`, controlled with `dinitctl`
- Real users: per-process credentials, file permission checks, setuid binaries,
  and a console `login` prompt. shadow-utils (`login`, `su`, `passwd`) and
  `sudo` are ported. The image ships `root` / `root` and `tunix` / `tunix` —
  see [Users and Permissions](docs/users-and-permissions.md)
- A full Xfce desktop on Xorg (xfwm4, xfce4-panel, xfdesktop, Thunar and
  xfce4-terminal), started by the session of whoever logs in, so it runs as
  that user; a Weston (Wayland) session is also available
- A graphical login: LightDM with lightdm-gtk-greeter owns the display from
  boot, authenticating through Linux-PAM — see
  [Display Manager](docs/display-manager.md)

## Quick Start

Initialize submodules first:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build the disk image:

```sh
make all
```

Run it in QEMU:

```sh
make run
```

Or run headless:

```sh
make headless
```

Clean generated files:

```sh
make clean
```
