 * buffers via memory_write) far too low: `git clone` of a real repo writes a
 * multi-MB pack into RAM and, with the capacity-doubling realloc's transient
 * ~2x peak, exhausted the heap and surfaced as EPERM write errors. 768 MiB sits

 * bytes, so every pointer handed out was block+24 -- 8-aligned at best -- and
 * an `__attribute__((aligned(16)))` member inside a kmalloc'd struct was a
 * promise the allocator could not keep. Padding the header to a multiple of 16
