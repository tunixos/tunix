/*
 * The local APIC and the IOAPIC, which is how interrupts arrive on anything
 * newer than the 8259 pair this kernel started on.
 *
 * The difference that matters is routing. With the PIC, a device's interrupt
 * line *is* its IRQ number. With an IOAPIC the firmware decides which of its
 * inputs a line is wired to, and says so in the MADT -- so IRQ 0 commonly
 * arrives on input 2, and a line can be active-low or level-triggered where
 * the PIC's were neither. Getting that wrong does not produce a wrong
 * interrupt; it produces silence, which is much harder to read.
 *
 * Vectors are unchanged: the PIC was already remapped to 32..47, so the same
 * handlers answer and only the delivery path underneath them moves.
