/*
 * Just enough /sys for udev to enumerate devices.
 *
 * Weston's DRM backend finds both its display and its input devices through
 * libudev, and libudev-zero -- the small replacement we ship instead of
 * systemd's udev -- does that by scanning /sys/dev/char and /sys/dev/block.
 * Without those directories nothing is discoverable and the backend gives up
 * before it starts.
 *
 * This is not sysfs. It is the three things libudev-zero actually reads,
 * derived once at boot from the devices we already have:
 *
 *   /sys/devices/<name>/uevent       MAJOR=/MINOR=/DEVNAME= lines
 *   /sys/devices/<name>/subsystem    symlink whose basename is the subsystem
 *   /sys/dev/char/<major>:<minor>    symlink to the device directory
 *
 * The symlink is what makes udev report a sensible name: it resolves the
 * numeric path and takes the last component, so `card0` rather than `226:0`.
 *
 * /sys/dev/block exists even with nothing in it, because libudev-zero treats a
 * failed scandir of *either* directory as a failure of the whole enumeration.
