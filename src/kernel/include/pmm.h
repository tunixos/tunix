 * How much physical memory the machine may use.
 *
 * This used to be 1792 MiB, and not by choice: the direct map started at
 * KERNEL_BASE and the framebuffer window sat exactly that far above it. The
 * map has its own PML4 entry now, so what remains is a limit on the bookkeeping
 * rather than on the address space -- the allocator's bitmap and per-page
 * reference counts are reserved after the kernel image by the linker script,
 * and they cost about 544 KiB for every gigabyte. 8 GiB needs 4.25 MiB of the
 * 8 MiB reserved there; raising this means raising that too.
 *
 * The structures are sized from the memory map at boot, not from this, so a
 * machine with 2 GiB pays for 2 GiB.
